### Getting Vector data from Crop Census dataset
- See TestGDAL on Richard's Branch to see how this works...
- Currently opens the landiq .gbb file and writes all the Santa Barbara county vectors into individual .json files
  - The county can be specified for later uses
  - Also the .gbd path will depend on your system
- To run:
  -```python ExtractVetorData.py```
- The json files might need to be formatted better
- I have uploaded these files to the ubuntu server

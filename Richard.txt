They python script weather_api_test.py creates a csv of temperature records at a 
Santa Barbara weather station. The specific parameters will be changed later in regards to 
the location of our other data. This data will be added to our database and will have a
table entry with psql. I am also working on creating tables for the other datasets in our 
database.

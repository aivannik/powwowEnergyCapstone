Daniel Updates for October 18th:

This week, I mainly focused on learning what data we had to work with and how to model that in a database.

We received access to the ETa data on Tuesday, and I read through the instructions to try to understand what it contianed. ETa is Evapotranspiration data and the Reference doc contained a lot of jargon that I will be speaking with our mentor Thomas about.

We did not yet receive the data for the other layers, but I did look up what data might potentially be in them. 
I found these two links and read through them:
https://water.ca.gov/LegacyFiles/groundwater/casgem/pdfs/CASGEM%20DWR%20GW%20Guidelines%20Final%20121510.pdf

https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44093.pdf

I also created a stub database:
CREATE TABLE stub( col1 int, PRIMARY KEY (col1) )

I wrote a stub script to read from this database as practice to know how to do it later. It’s still doesn’t work exactly. It is committed to my own branch.

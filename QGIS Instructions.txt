First, I want to only select the vectors that are overlapping a raster.
2. Convert raster mask to vector with GDALTools (Raster menu) Conversion -> Polygonize
3. Processing -> Toolbox. Select the Settings (The little wrench) and under the Processing menu, select General. Change Invalid Feature Filtering to "Ignore Invalid Input Features"
4. In the Toolbox, use Select by Location. Choose the overlay to be the polygonized raster layer.
Now all the fields that overlap the raster layer should be selected.

Remove z-axis off of the dataset. The z-axis messes up the zonal statistics.
Right click the vector layer, select Export --> Save Features As 
Save an ESRI Shapefile. Put the new vectors in this coordinate system: EPSG:32611 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N
Under Geometry type, select Polygon and uncheck Include z-dimension

Now in the Toolbox, search Zonal Statistics
Select the raster file and the modified feature vector.


To add the X,Y coordinates:
Select the vector layer.
Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Centroids
Create a new layer of centroids.
Now select this centroid layer.
Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Add Geometry Attributes
Now you can create a layer with the centroid x,y coordinates added to the attribute table
